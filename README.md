Hi! I am currently a student at Flatiron School learning JavaScript, React, Python, Flask, HTML, CSS, and SQL. I have a passion for problem-solving, thinking critically, learning soemthing new, collaborating with other coders,  and spending countless hours debugging.  

## Projects:
- **[Beers Cheers](https://github.com/Amii911/phase-1-project)** | This is the first project I've coded and most proud of. 
- **[Bloggin BLog](https://github.com/Amii911/bloggin-blog)** |  This is the React project that I submitted for my Phase Two project. 

## Interests:
- **Tennis**: I enjoy playing tennis. I played throughout High School and College, **FUN FACT**: I learned shot put in College and still throw today. 
- **Reading**: I may not be great with book clubs but I will not deny a good recommended book. I enjoy reading daily.
- **Meet Ups**:  I've grown a liking to finding random meet-ups in NYC and attending them. 
- **Foodie**: I enjoy cooking but can't help but share that NYC has a plethora of restaurants and dining that I cannot resist.
