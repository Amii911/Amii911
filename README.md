# Aminat Adebayo ðŸ‘‹
Hi! I am currently a student at Flatiron School learning JavaScript, React, Python, Flask, HTML, CSS, and SQL. I have a passion for problem-solving, thinking critically, learning something new, collaborating with other coders,  and spending countless hours debugging.  

## Projects:
- **[Beers Cheers](https://github.com/Amii911/phase-1-project)** | Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and with a public API. 
- **[Bloggin Blog](https://github.com/Amii911/bloggin-blog)** | A single page application using create-react-app.
- **[TransXceed](https://github.com/Amii911/TransXceed)** | A CLI application with a database created and modified with SQLAlchemy 

## Interests:
- **Tennis**: I enjoy playing tennis. I played throughout High School and College and still play today. **FUN FACT**: I learned shot put in College and still throw today. 
- **Reading**: I may not be great with book clubs but I will not deny a good recommended book. I enjoy reading daily.
- **Meet Ups**:  I've grown a liking to finding random meet-ups in NYC and attending them. 
- **Foodie**: I enjoy cooking but can't help to share that NYC has a plethora of restaurants and dining that I cannot resist.
